# ABOUT ME

I am a fresher Data Scientist with a background in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about using data to extract insights and make predictions. Furthermore, I am currently learning and experimenting with  various Machine Learning algorithms and tools. I am eager to work on projects that involve Machine Learning to get more experience.



# SKILLS

•	Proficient in Python.

•	Familiar with machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, OpenCV TensorFlow, and Keras

•	Experience with data visualization using Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and PowerBI .

•	Familiar with SQL, Flask, Azur and AWS.


# PROJECTS

### Movie Recommendation System

•	TMDB 5000 Movie Datasets were used to make the recommendation system. This project was completed using python and some libraries like pandas and sci kit learn.

•	To get better accuracy, I combine 'credits' and 'movies' dataset. Then I did some EDA to get clean and valuable data. 

•	And vectorize them to measure the distance of one movie to another movie. Finally, create a function to recommend movies through this vector.

### Garments Identification Machine using CNN

•	This system can identify the type of clothing in a given photo. Worked independently to clean, analyze, visualize and predict in given fashion dataset. 

•	This project was completed using Python. For analyze and visualize the dataset I use some python library like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

•	With the help of Keras, I create a CNN model and train it with 15 epochs. Finally, it is able to classify the image of fashion dataset.

### The disease identifier for cotton using Transfer Learning 

•	This project based on "transfer learning". This system is able to identify if this cotton has the disease or not. Worked independently to analyze, and visualize, the dataset. This project was completed using Python, a library called NumPy and implemented in "Google Colab". 

•	I used Keras and TensorFlow to create a deep learning model. I used "categorical_crossentropy" and "Adam optimizer" to train the model. With the help of "ImageDataGenerator" I rescale the images. 

•	Finally, with the help of "resnet50", my deep learning model was trained to 76 percent accuracy in identifying whether an image is depicting disease or not.

### Delhi-House-Price-Prediction

•	 Feature Engineering part gave me a good dataset for implement Machine Learning Algorithm in this Dataset.

•	Then i implement some machine learning algorithm such as linear regression, Ridge and lasso regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, k nearest neighbor regression, decision trees, random forest.

•	The best accuracy I got from random forest   with criterion “mean absolute error”  which is approximately 82%.
