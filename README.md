# ABOUT ME

I am a fresher Data Scientist with a background in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about using data to extract insights and make predictions. Furthermore, I am currently learning and experimenting with  various Machine Learning algorithms and tools. I am eager to work on projects that involve Machine Learning to get more experience.



# SKILLS

•	Proficient in Python.

•	Familiar with machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, OpenCV TensorFlow, and Keras

•	Experience with data visualization using Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and PowerBI .

•	Familiar with SQL, Flask, Azur and AWS.


# PROJECTS

### Cinematch: The Personalized Movie Recommendation System

• Developed a movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movie Datasets in Python. Utilized pandas for data cleaning and manipulation, and scikit-learn for creating the recommendation model. 

• Combined 'credits' and 'movies' dataset to improve the performance of the system. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract valuable data and then vectorized them to measure the distance of one movie to another movie. 

• Achieved an accuracy of 85% in recommending movies based on a user's preferences. Implemented a function to recommend movies through this vector. 

### FashionFrenzy: A Clothing Identifier using CNN

• Developed an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can identify the type of clothing in a given photo. 

• This project was completed using Python. Worked independently to clean, analyze and visualize the fashion dataset using python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

• With the help of Keras, I create a CNN model and train it with 15 epochs. Finally, it is able to classify the image of fashion dataset.

### GreenGuard: Cotton Disease Identification using Transfer Learning 

• Developed a deep learning model using Transfer Learning technique to identify if a cotton plant has a disease or not.

• Worked independently to analyze, visualize and preprocess the dataset using python library NumPy. Implemented the model in Google Colab using Keras and TensorFlow, used categorical_crossentropy as a loss function and Adam optimizer for training the model. Utilized ImageDataGenerator to rescale the images. 

• Achieved an accuracy of 76% in identifying whether an image is depicting disease or not using ResNet50 model. 

### Delhi-House-Price-Prediction

•	 Feature Engineering part gave me a good dataset for implement Machine Learning Algorithm in this Dataset.

•	Then i implement some machine learning algorithm such as linear regression, Ridge and lasso regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, k nearest neighbor regression, decision trees, random forest.

•	The best accuracy I got from random forest   with criterion “mean absolute error”  which is approximately 82%.
